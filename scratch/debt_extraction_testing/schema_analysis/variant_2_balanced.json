{
  "overview": "This schema extracts key deal terms from credit agreement exhibits, capturing contracting parties, facility structures, pricing, schedule, and governing law. It covers one or more credit facility tranches, interest rate benchmarks and spreads, effective and maturity dates, and applicable jurisdiction. Each field maps directly to text observable within the exhibit, enabling standardized comparison across agreements. Repeating elements like parties, facilities, and interest terms are modeled as arrays of objects. Date and amount fields are normalized for quantitative analysis. The schema omits header metadata and focuses strictly on substantive contractual provisions. It supports downstream queries on counterparty exposure, pricing variations, and legal context. By structuring core provisions, the schema facilitates automated portfolio monitoring and risk analytics.",
