  "overview": "This schema captures the essential, observable provisions of a Master Credit Agreement exhibit. It extracts the transacting parties and their roles, the type and amount of the credit facility, the interest rate benchmark and spread, the effective and maturity dates, and the governing law. Each field maps directly to verbatim text in the agreement. Repeating concepts (e.g., parties) are represented as arrays of objects. The schema omits generic EDGAR metadata and focuses solely on facts within the exhibit that analysts will query. It ensures consistent downstream quantitative analysis of credit terms across similar agreements.",
